For anybody that stumbles across this folder, I want to make it known that the ME7.2 ECU for the BMW 540i cars have many
different versions of the firmware.

Each version of the firmware is different, and the memory locations corresponding to the XDF files are all different.
If you find these 64k dumps, and you flash them to a vehicle with the wrong firmware this could potentially damage your ecu, or car.

You must make sure you have the same initial firmware version, and only flash a 64k tune that matches your firmware version.

The bins in this folder are labeled with FW## for the firmware version they go with. Do not flash a FW55 bin with anything 
other than an ecu already running FW55 firmware.

The tools are now public to flash bins to the ecu, don't make the mistake of breaking stuff.

You can use a hex editor on your 64k dump and using the memory addresses in existing XDF files you can match up the
corresponding tables, and settings with a version of the firmware we have not covered yet. But until we have the ability to 
release any kind of publicly available EWS deleted 512k dump that everyone can flash to convert their ecu to a unified firmware
version, you must take carefull steps in ensuring you dont damage your vehicle.

That being said, I dont take any responsibility towards anybody that flashes my firmware onto their ecu and bricks it or worse.



If you are knowledgeble on the MS43 ecu's you would know that in order to use the XDF files, they first have you flash the 
ECU with a 512k flash. This flash is what makes your ECU match the XDF they provide to tune your car. We currently do not have a 
universal 512k flash for everyones ECU. Until then please be carefull!
